    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oven to 325Â°F. In large bowl, beat brown sugar, shortening, molasses and egg with electric mixer on medium speed, or mix with spoon. Stir in remaining ingredients except granulated sugar.</li>
      <li>Shape dough by rounded tablespoonfuls into 1 1/2-inch balls. Dip tops into granulated sugar. On ungreased cookie sheet, place balls, sugared sides up, about 2 inches apart.</li>
      <li>Bake 13 to 16 minutes or just until set and cookies appear dry. Immediately remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Expert Tip</h2>
    <p> Purchase shortening formed in oblong packages marked for easy cutting and measuring. It eliminates messy measuring in cups. Spray the inside of the measuring cup with cooking spray so molasses will slide out of the cup easily.</p>
